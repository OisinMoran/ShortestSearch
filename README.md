# ShortestSearch
Program to find the shortest phrase to Google to ensure a given URL is the first result

## Motivation
Standard URLs are hard to remember and take too long to type; URL-shorteners give links that are easier to type but even harder to remember; and when instructing someone to Google something we often give them too much information.

This aims to perfect the art of *"It should be the first result if you Google 'x y z' "*.

## Usage
Example Input: https://www.ted.com/talks/david_eagleman_can_we_create_new_senses_for_human

Example Output: "TED VEST"

**Note:** Google's search results are location dependent, therefore:
* for a given URL, the shortest phrase will not necessarily be the same for everyone
* a given phrase may not return the intended URL as the first search result for everyone
